Use of Docker to run the pre-configured docker image for Privoxy/TOR available at https://hub.docker.com/r/dperson/torproxy/. I will also run ACHE and Elasticsearch using docker containers.

-Prerequisites and system informaition:
System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64bit (doesn't work on 32bit)
-curl command(if not installed): sudo apt-get install curl 
You need the command
sudo apt-get install curl
First update
Also you want to run update first:
sudo apt-get update
And you might want to consider using this command:
sudo apt-get install libcurl3 php5-curl

-First, verify that docker-compose is included in the Docker version you have.

docker-compose -v

-If it is not installed:

apt install docker.io
apt install docker-compose

-Confirm the installation
docker-compose --version

-Create the configuration files

mkdir config_docker_tor/
cd config_docker_tor/
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/master/config/config_docker_tor/ache.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/master/config/config_docker_tor/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViDA-NYU/ache/master/config/config_docker_tor/tor.seeds

-Start the Docker containers
Enter the directory config_docker_tor you just created and start the containers with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up -d

This command will automatically download all docker images and start all necessary containers in background mode. The downloads may take a while to finish depending on your Internet connection speed.

-Monitor the crawl progress
If you want to visualize the crawler logs, you can run:

    docker-compose logs -f

-Stop the Docker containers
You can stop the containers by hitting CTRL+C on Linux. You can also remove the containers by running the following command:

    docker-compose down
